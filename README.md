# iOS-Portfolio-Patil22

Hi, my name is Rohit Patil and I am currently a Senior in High School.

## New to Github

  I have recently learned to use GitHub Desktop, which is extremely convenient to push and pull changes when working with multiple people. I am also learning to make repositories and connecting them to XCode projects.


## New to XCode

  I have spent hours learning how to use the basics of XCode. I have experience with coding in Java after taking AP Java my junior year. Therefore, I have spent time trying to learn the new syntax of XCode. I have also followed a tutorial to make an app that shows the location of a landmark. This is a very basic app to help get the feel of XCode. I am currently working on a Tip Calculator App as well as an app that helps a user navigate around our Eden Prairie High School, given a staring room and an ending room.
