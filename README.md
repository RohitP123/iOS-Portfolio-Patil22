# iOS-Portfolio-Patil22

Hi, my name is Rohit Patil and I am currently a Senior in High School. I have taken AP Computer Science A: Java, in 11th grade. Now I am currently in iOS, where we use Swift to create apps.

## New to Github

  I have learned to use GitHub Desktop, which is extremely convenient to push and pull changes when working with multiple people. I am also learning to make repositories and connecting them to XCode projects.


## XCode

  I have spent hours learning how to use the basics of XCode. I have experience with coding in Java after taking AP Java my junior year. Therefore, I have spent time trying to learn the new syntax of XCode. I have also followed a tutorial to make an app that shows the location of a landmark. This is a very basic app to help get the feel of XCode. I also created a Tip Calculator App following a tutorial, to better understand Swift syntax. I am currently working on an app that helps a user navigate around our Eden Prairie High School, given a staring room and an ending room.
  

[Cash Register App](/https://github.com/RohitP123/Cash-Register-App)
This is an app I have been working on that is supposed to help a person count the money in a cash register quickly and efficiently. It how two specific functions to adding bills and coins. One is pressing the button to add or subtract a quantity, and the other is a slider allowing one to scroll to a specific quantity of bills or coins quickly. Also, there is an option to manually put in an amount of money. Also, there is a save value button, which saves the total money you have inputted, as well as a history to show what has been added or subtracted. This app is hopefully useful for small businesses or anyone that require money to be counted and saved quickly.
